# ACU Campus Center
Model of Abilene Christian University's McGlothlin Campus Center, created in Blender 2.79.
This will be easier to download on different computers, because I don't want to upload files or install Google Drive every time.
Note that this is a very large building, and the land the building is on isn't completely flat, so there is variation in the height of the foundation.
